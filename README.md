# Colonizer
Appends semi-colons (or whatever you want!) at the end of the current line.

#### Its default key bindings are  
**ctrl+;**: Append a semi-colon at the end of the line.  
**alt+;**: Append a semi-colon and a line break at the end of the line.

### Changing the appended character  
In order to change the appended character, you can set the "colonizer.value" user or workspace setting.

### Changing the key bindings  
You can change the default key bindings by redefining the "extension.colonize" and "extension.colonizeAndBreakLine" commands.

Enjoy it, and contributions are welcome!
